Json.<i></i>NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET

Available for installation with

- **Unity Package Manager (UPM)** `recommended!`
- ~~Unity Asset packages~~ _(coming soon)_
- ~~Unity Asset Store~~ _(coming soon)_
- ~~NuGet package~~ _(coming soon)_

This repo is a **fork** of [JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json][newtonsoft.json.git] containing custom builds
for regular standalone, but more importantly AOT targets such as all **IL2CPP builds**
**(WebGL, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac OS X)** and portable .NET **(UWP, WP8)**.

## Development

### Merging changes from JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json

As an example, this is how to make a release for Json.<i></i>NET 12.0.3, resulting in
Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity (this project) version 12.0.301. Check the
[About the versioning](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity/wiki/About-the-versioning)
guide on the Wiki about the version format.

1. If not yet done, create the release branch `release/12.0.301` based off of
   the `master` branch.

2. Checkout a new feature branch `feature/merge-12.0.3` based off of the
   `release/12.0.301` branch.

3. Merge the changes from the release tag of JamesNK repo.
   For some files the changes are too grand and the auto merging fails.
   Make sure then to compare said files with the actual changeset on JamesNKs
   repo, like so: <https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/compare/12.0.2...12.0.3>

    ```bash
    git checkout feature/merge-12.0.3
    git pull https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json.git 12.0.3
    # Resolve merge conflicts
    # Only proceed when fully done
    git commit -m "Merge from JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json 12.0.3 into feature/merge-12.0.3"
    git push
    ```

4. Create a merge request from `feature/merge-12.0.3` to `release/12.0.301`  
   <https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity/compare/release/12.0.301...feature/merge-12.0.3>

### Run tests

Run the Newtonsoft.Json.Tests normally via the Test Runner inside Visual Studio.

For testing inside Unity locally, look inside the
[Src/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity.Tests/README.md](/Src/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity.Tests/README.md)
for more information.
