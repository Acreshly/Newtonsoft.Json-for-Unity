Json.NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET

Available for installation with

- **Unity Package Manager (UPM)** `recommended!`
- ~~Unity Asset packages~~ _(coming soon)_
- ~~Unity Asset Store~~ _(coming soon)_
- ~~NuGet package~~ _(coming soon)_

This repo is a **fork** of [JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json][newtonsoft.json.git] containing custom builds
for regular standalone, but more importantly AOT targets such as all **IL2CPP builds**
**(WebGL, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac OS X)** and portable .NET **(UWP, WP8)**.

## [Installation guide](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity/wiki/Installation-Using-UPM)

## Versioning format

_Staying with JamesNK's version syntax, but with a twist :dizzy:_

To allow deployment of patches of the package itself, and keep confusion to a low, I'm only appending a double digit for versioning of this repository. Deployment of Newtonsoft.Json version `12.0.1` will be deployed with the UPM version `12.0.100`, `12.0.101`, `12.0.102` etc. It's still `12.0.1` version of the assembly, but some other stuff around the package will have changed. See the [releases](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity/releases) tab for version-specific changelogs.

To contribute first you must read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md)
guidelines. It contains info about

- How to edit the Src/Newtonsoft.Json projects to remain the ability to merge
  from JamesNKs repository without difficulties.
- Coding style.
- Naming style.
- Our level of usage of "git-flow".
- Keep the repo clean, both code & branches.

SaladLab and ParentElement, among other unmentioned coders,
have done great work in making Json.NET work in Unity. _So why do we need mine?_

Both mentioned projects are discontinued, and outdated by some margin in result.
SaladLab's latest release targets Json.NET 9, and ParentElement's Json.NET 8.
We're at Json.NET 12 now! _(at time of writing)_

Changeset, compared to SaladLabs and ParentElements solutions:

- Json.NET version 12 _(let's see how long I can keep up with James repo)_
- Release available via Unity Package Manager
- Unit testing in Unity Editor
- Unit testing in IL2CPP built platforms _(ex: StandaloneWindows)_

A rework is in this case easier than jumping into SaladLabs project to update it. Sorry Salad champ.

<sub>_Although, in the future this may also be old stuff too,
with the upcoming new [System.Text.Json](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/try-the-new-system-text-json-apis/)
namespace and need to keep the project up-to-date with Newtonsoft.Json.
But not for now!_</sub>
